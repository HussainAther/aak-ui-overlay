# 🎮 AAK UI Overlay (Session HUD)

The **AAK UI Overlay** is a real-time Streamlit interface that displays live session feedback from the AAK AI Copilot. It's built for researchers and developers to **see their productivity signals in action** — keystrokes, idle time, task alignment, and Claude chat guidance.

---

## 🧠 What It Shows

- ⌨️ Keystroke bursts
- 🖱️ Mouse movement intensity
- ⏱️ Idle time (seconds since last input)
- 🎯 Task match score from Claude
- 📩 Recent Claude messages (interventions, alignment feedback)

---

## 📡 Real-Time Data Feed

This UI listens for data generated by the [`aak-ai-copilot`](https://github.com/YOURORG/aak-ai-copilot):

| Source File         | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `live_metrics.json` | Real-time stream of metrics (idle, keys)   |
| `copilot_log.jsonl` | Claude messages and alignment feedback     |

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Streamlit

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas
```

### 2. Launch the HUD

```bash
streamlit run overlay.py
```

It will continuously read from the data files above and update every second.
